If the blockchain is the computer, then in this metaphor of ours the client binary (for example: <a href="/iroha-2-docs/guide/get-started/operate-iroha-2-via-cli.html"><code>iroha</code></a>) is the keyboard, the blockchain is the hard drive, and the Iroha peer software is the processor. Like a processor, Iroha accepts portable instructions that modify what&#39;s written to the blockchain, allow certain users to use the network, and lock others out.</p><p>Any operation that is run on-chain is written in terms of <a href="/iroha-2-docs/guide/blockchain/instructions.html">Iroha Special Instructions (ISI)</a>, and there is no other way of modifying the world state.</p><p>Each interaction with the blockchain is done via a <em>transaction</em>. A transaction is a collection of <em>instructions</em>, which are either glued together in sequence or compiled into what we affectionately call a <a href="/iroha-2-docs/guide/blockchain/wasm.html">WASM</a> blob. You need these instructions to register an account, remove an account, add X amount of Y currency, and so on.</p><p>To read the information encoded in the blocks of a blockchain (the current world state), you use <a href="/iroha-2-docs/guide/blockchain/queries.html">queries</a>. Queries are submitted like instructions, but they&#39;re not tracked and recorded in blocks, so they&#39;re much more lightweight. If you use queries as part of complicated logic (e.g. inside WASM), they have a non-negligible impact on the size of the blocks. Queries that are only used to get information leave no trace in the blockchain.</p>',5),n=[i];function h(s,c,d,l,u,p){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const k=e(r,[["render",h]]);export{w as __pageData,k as default};
